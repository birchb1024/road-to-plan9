Hi,

My name is Peter Birch. I am a programmer with a Unix/Linux upbringing - I 
have spent decades making my living from Code.  At the moment I'm a
'devop' messing about with Terraform, Kubernetes and Azure.

Increasingly I hear echoes of Plan 9 in the software I use,
from Linux /proc to WSL [1]. Clearly Plan 9 has been very influential,
hence worthy of study. (Is Plan 9 the Lisp of Operating Systems?)

I have set out to learn and use Plan 9. The pathway to learn Plan 9 is 
not as straightforward as say Linux, it was a research project. 
There is no Book. There are many forks in the road. 

This repository collects a travelogue of my personal road to PLan 9.  
It's public - maybe other pilgrims might find it useful.

See you on the trail!

Peter
